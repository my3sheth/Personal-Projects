1.	NIDS USING A META-ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL

Python | Machine Learning | Pandas | IMBLEARN | Matplotlib | PowerBI

Engineered a meta-ensemble intrusion detection model using LR, GNB, and LDA with Borderline SMOTE, SelectKBest, and soft Voting Classifier, boosting evaluation scores via ROC-AUC, PR-AUC and confusion matrix and visualizing the metrics using PowerBI.


2.	STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Python | OOPs | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn

Developed an object-oriented application to record, analyze, and visualize academic performance across Grades 10â€“12. Automated grade classification, calculated overall percentages, and generated visual insights using bar and line plots for class-wise comparison.


3.	COVID ANALYSIS

Python | MySQL | Matplotlib | Pandas | SQLAlchemy

Developed an interactive COVID-19 Data Analysis Tool by integrating MySQL with Python using SQLAlchemy and Pandas for city-wise case distribution, wave comparisons, and gender-wise impact visualized using Matplotlib for modular visualization.
