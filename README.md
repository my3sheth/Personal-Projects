1.	NIDS USING A META-ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL


Python | Machine Learning | Pandas | IMBLEARN | Matplotlib | PowerBI
Engineered a meta-ensemble intrusion detection model using LR, GNB, and LDA with Borderline SMOTE, SelectKBest, and soft Voting Classifier, boosting evaluation scores via ROC-AUC, PR-AUC and confusion matrix and visualizing the metrics using PowerBI.


2.	IMDb TOP 1,000 MOVIES ANALYSIS

Python | Machine Learning | TensorFlow | Keras | Seaborn

Built and deployed an interactive IMDB movie revenue predictor using sklearn and regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, and MLP Regressor, achieving performance evaluation via R² Score, MAE, and RMSE and integrated a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow Keras, optimized through loss curves. 


3.	STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Python | OOPs | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn

Developed an object-oriented application to record, analyze, and visualize academic performance across Grades 10–12. Automated grade classification, calculated overall percentages, and generated visual insights using bar and line plots for class-wise comparison.


4.	COVID ANALYSIS

Python | MySQL | Matplotlib | Pandas | SQLAlchemy

Developed an interactive COVID-19 Data Analysis Tool by integrating MySQL with Python using SQLAlchemy and Pandas for city-wise case distribution, wave comparisons, and gender-wise impact visualized using Matplotlib for modular visualization.
